# Algorithms & Data Structures Visualizer 

#### _Team Week Project, 2020_

#### By _**Austin Schrader, Nathan Schrader,**_

## Introduction

We believe our Team Project should speak directly to our audience. As students of a coding school who intend on becoming software engineers, our audience is anyone who directly influences the hiring process of software engineers. This could include tech recruiters, senior software engineers, and internal HR hiring managers.

One thing we feel confident about is that all of these individuals want to see that a candidate clearly understands the necessary fundamentals of the job - and in the software engineering field, data structures and algorithms are at the top of the list of skills. In fact, these are at the core of nearly all technical interviews. 


Other possible sections of the Summary:

Team members needed: back end, front end, 

## Project Goals

**Demonstrate team member's understanding of:**
  
  * Data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Binary Search Trees, Stacks, Queues, etc.
  * Sorting algorithms: MergeSort, QuickSort, BubbleSort, etc.
  * When to use them.
  
**Benefits of project:**

* A tool for team members to learn popular data structures and algorithms frequently used in the field. We feel this is of particular importance, as Epicodus does not directly instruct on these necessary skills.
* An important by-product of applying these skills is that we will gain an intimate understanding of "Big O notation" - used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
* A fun way to present these concepts in a visual way to others who use our application learn, too.
* A method for clearly communicating our knowledge as coding students to those who would have a direct impact in our job search.

_A finished project will allow a user to navigate our web application to select a particular data structure filled with N-number of items, and apply one of many sorting algorithms to the data set. We will utilize creative visualizations to display results to the user._







## Project Tasks Need Completed - (Move out of README eventually)
- User input fields: How many #'s would you like to generate
- Buttons to select the sorting algorithm
- Buttons to select the data structure to be used
- Front end graphs need generated from (X,Y) data. X: # of operations and Y: Time to sort # of operations
    a) Sorting Visualizer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc&ab_channel=Cl%C3%A9mentMihailescu)
    b) Sorting Graph (https://miro.medium.com/max/825/1*iQkFjNn02oogc2Yv27-pyQ.png)
- Implement sorting algorithms
- Implement data structures
- README (Good example: https://github.com/PRKille/HeardInvetory)
- Test algorithm functions
- Should the data structures implementation be objects? And the algorithms would be methods on the objects?
